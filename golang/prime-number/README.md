To find and print prime numbers under one billion in Go, you can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is an efficient way to find all primes less than a given limit. Below is an example of how to implement this in Go:

Explanation
sieveOfEratosthenes Function:

Initializes a boolean array `prime` where each index represents whether the number is prime.
Iterates over the array and marks the non-prime numbers.
Collects and returns all prime numbers.
main Function:

Sets the limit to one billion.
Calls the `sieveOfEratosthenes` function to get all primes under one billion.
Prints each prime number.
Real-World Use Case
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is widely used for generating a list of prime numbers for cryptographic algorithms, random number generation, and within mathematical research where prime numbers are a fundamental topic.

Remember that printing all prime numbers under one billion will result in a very large output. You might want to limit the output or write it to a file for practical purposes.
