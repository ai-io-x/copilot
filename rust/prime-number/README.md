To find and print prime numbers under one billion in Rust, you can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. This algorithm is efficient for generating a list of prime numbers up to a given limit. Below is an example implementation in Rust:

# Explanation
sieve_of_eratosthenes Function:

Initializes a boolean vector `prime` where each index represents whether the number is prime.
Iterates over the vector and marks the non-prime numbers.
Collects and returns all prime numbers.
main Function:

Sets the limit to one billion.
Calls the `sieve_of_eratosthenes` function to get all primes under one billion.
Prints each prime number.

# Considerations

Time and Space Complexity: This algorithm is efficient, but generating and storing prime numbers up to one billion can require significant time and memory. Ensure your system has enough resources.
Output Size: Printing all prime numbers under one billion will generate a very large output. Consider writing the output to a file or limiting the number of primes you print if you are running this in a typical environment.
Real-World Use Case
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is commonly used in various fields such as cryptography, number theory, and computer science research, where prime number generation is essential.
