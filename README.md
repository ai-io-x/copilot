## [Prime number]:

- A [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself.

- In mathematics, the [sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.
